            <p id="style3">Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord,
                and peripheral nerves. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including biology, psychology, and
                medicine.
                Understanding brain function is essential for unravelling the mysteries of human behaviour, cognition,
                and
                emotion.</p>
            <p id="style3">The human brain is an incredibly complex organ, consisting of approximately 86 billion
                neurons that communicate through trillions of synapses. It is responsible for our thoughts, emotions,
                memories, and
                movements, making it central to our existence. The brain is divided into various regions, each
                responsible for specific functions. For instance, the cerebrum, the largest part of the brain, is
                involved in higher cognitive functions such as reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
                Meanwhile, the cerebellum
                plays a critical role in coordinating movement and balance, highlighting the intricate specialization
                within this remarkable organ.</p>

            <p id="style3">Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to
                experiences, learning, and injury. This remarkable property allows the brain to form new neural
                connections
                throughout life, enabling recovery from trauma and adaptation to new environments.</p>
            <p id="style3">Neuroplasticity is particularly prominent during childhood, a period when the brain is
                rapidly
                developing and learning new skills. However, recent research has shown that adults also retain
                significant
                plasticity. allowing them to continue learning and adapting well into old age.</p>

                        areas.</li>
                    <li>Structural Plasticity: The brain's ability to physically change its structure in response to
